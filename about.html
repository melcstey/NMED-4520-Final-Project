        <h7>Why switch the decades around?</h7>
        <p>Imagining a world without the same music devices that we have today is difficult to think about. The freedom we have today to listen to music is a great difference compared to the 70s. Today we are able to take our music with us anywhere, use Bluetooth to extend music to speakers and talk to home devices such as Google Home to play our music. I wanted to create a site that changes the perspective of how we see music. If we had to wait until we got home to play our favourite album on our record players, or if we had to only listen to the radio because we couldnâ€™t Bluetooth our phones to our cars. How would this change your daily encounter with music?</p>

        <h8>How it's made?</h8>
        <p15>This site is CSS-based using strictly CSS animation.
            <br>Block images are the base for this site to demonstrate the switch of music throughout the decades.</p15>
